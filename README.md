# Reservelt - Rental Management

## Problem Statement

Rental application streamlines the entire rental process.  
It provides a unified platform to manage products, schedule pickups.

Online booking and reservations are done through a website portal.  
Customers can shop available products, reserve their selected dates,  
and checkout right on the website.

Whether you rent by the hour, week, month or year, create customized  
pricing for every product based on different time frames.

### Roles

- **Customer** – The person or entity making the booking and payment.
- **End User** – The person actually using the rented product (may or may not be the same as the customer).
